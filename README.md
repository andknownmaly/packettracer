## ⚠️ Important Notes for Version 8.2.2

### Login Issue Workaround

**Version 8.2.2 uses isolated libraries** and may experience login problems due to library isolation. If you need to use version 8.2.2:

#### Recommended Workaround:
1. **First install version 9.0.0** using the script (Option 2)
2. Login to your Cisco NetAcad account in version 9.0.0
3. Uninstall version 9.0.0 (Option 3)
4. Install version 8.2.2 (Option 1)

This workaround allows 8.2.2 to inherit the authentication from 9.0.0, bypassing the isolated library login issue.

**Alternative:** If you don't need login functionality, version 8.2.2 works fine for local projects and offline usage.

## 📝 Additional Notes

### General
* If you face permission issues, **do not** run with `sudo`. The script will ask for sudo password when needed.
* The unified script automatically detects if Packet Tracer is already installed and shows version information.

### Version 9.0.0 Specific
* **Recommended version** for most users
* Uses AppImage format for easier installation
* Desktop launchers are automatically created in `~/.local/share/applications/`
* EULA acceptance is required on first run
* Icons are properly installed to avoid conflicts with other applications
* Better library compatibility
* Launchers created:
  - **Cisco Packet Tracer 9.0.0** - Main application
  - **Cisco Packet Tracer 9.0.0 (PTSA)** - Protocol handler

### Version 8.2.2 Specific
* **Legacy version** with isolated library system
* Traditional installation with library dependencies
* Desktop shortcut is created in `/usr/share/applications/`
* Requires additional system libraries (automatically downloaded)
* **Known Issue:** Login problems due to isolated libraries (see workaround above)
* Best for offline usage or when specific 8.2.2 features are needed
